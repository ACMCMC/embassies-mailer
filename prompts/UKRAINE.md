# Context
I am a resident in Ireland with Spanish citizenship.

I am looking forward to invest in Ukraine, but I want to get information on how to get an ID number for taxpayers in Ukraine.

For example, in Ireland, the ID number for taxpayers is the Personal Public Service (PPS) Number. I would like to get something like this, but for Ukraine. I have searched online but I couldn't find anything on the country.

Write an email to the embassy of Ukraine asking if they have any more information on how I should get this number. I am a citizen of Spain with permanent residence in Ireland. I am not a resident of Ukraine.

To write the email, first write some background information on the country. You should then user this information to customize the email to the embassy.

# Example
For example, for Brazil, you should write:

Background information:
Name of the ID number for taxpayers in Brazil: CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas)

Customized email to the embassy:

Subject: How should I get a CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas) in Brazil?
Body:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am a Spanish citizen (Spanish passport) with permanent residence in Ireland. I am looking forward to investing in Brazil, as a foreign investor (no residence in Brazil).

In order to do that, I am trying to understand the process of obtaining the number that identifies taxpayers in Brazil, to be able to declare the relevant information to the tax authorities.

I have been told that the number I should get is the CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas). Feel free to correct me if I am wrong.

I have searched online, but I couldn't find any information on how to get a CPF from abroad. This is why I am reaching out to you for guidance. If you could provide me with information on the process or direct me to the relevant authorities, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and any help you can provide.
