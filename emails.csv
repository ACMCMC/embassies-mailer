I am looking forward to invest in United States Of America, but I want to get information on how to get an ID number for taxpayers in United States Of America.

For example, in Ireland, the ID number for taxpayers is the Personal Public Service (PPS) Number. I would like to get something like this, but for United States Of America. I have searched online but I couldn't find anything on the country.

Write an email to the embassy of United States Of America asking if they have any more information on how I should get this number. I am a citizen of Spain with permanent residence in Ireland. I am not a resident of United States Of America.

To write the email, first write some background information on the country. You should then user this information to customize the email to the embassy.

Background information:
