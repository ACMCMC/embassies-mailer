Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am a Spanish citizen (Spanish passport) with permanent residence in Ireland. I am looking forward to investing in China, as a foreign investor (no residence in China).

In order to do that, I am trying to understand the process of obtaining the numbers that identify taxpayers in China, to be able to declare the relevant information to the tax authorities.

I have been told that the numbers I should get are either the Social Insurance Number (SI Number) or the Individual Income Tax Number (IIT Number). Feel free to correct me if I am wrong.

I have searched online, but I couldn't find any information on how to get a SI Number or IIT Number from abroad. This is why I am reaching out to you for guidance. If you could provide me with information on the process or direct me to the relevant authorities, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and any help you can provide.
