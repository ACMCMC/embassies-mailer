Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am a Spanish citizen (Spanish passport) with permanent residence in Ireland. I am not a resident of United Nations High Commissioner For Refugees, but I am interested in making a donation to the UNHCR.

In order to do that, I am trying to understand the process of obtaining the number that identifies individuals in the UNHCR, to be able to make the relevant donation and have a record of it.

I have been told that the number I should get is the UNHCR Individual Identification Number (IIN). Feel free to correct me if I am wrong.

I have searched online, but I couldn't find any information on how to get an IIN as a foreign donor. This is why I am reaching out to you for guidance. If you could provide me with information on the process or direct me to the relevant authorities, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and any help you can provide.
